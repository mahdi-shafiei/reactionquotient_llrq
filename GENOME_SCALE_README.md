## Quick Start

### Loading a Genome-Scale Model

```python
from llrq import load_genome_scale_model

# Load yeast-GEM with automatic optimizations
analyzer = load_genome_scale_model("yeast-GEM.xml")

# Print comprehensive model analysis
analyzer.print_summary()
```

### Creating LLRQ Systems

```python
from llrq import from_sbml

# Automatically detects large models and uses optimizations
network, dynamics, solver, visualizer = from_sbml("yeast-GEM.xml")

print(f"Created LLRQ system: {network.n_species} species, {network.n_reactions} reactions")
print(f"Sparse format: {network.is_sparse}, Sparsity: {network.sparsity:.2%}")
```

### Analyzing Compartments

```python
# Get compartment breakdown
compartments = analyzer.get_compartment_analysis()

for comp_id, data in compartments.items():
    print(f"{comp_id}: {data['n_species']} species, {data['n_internal_reactions']} internal reactions")

# Extract cytoplasmic submodel
cyto_model = analyzer.extract_compartment_submodel('c')
```

### Checking Model Quality

```python
# Numerical stability analysis
stability = analyzer.check_numerical_stability()

if stability['stability_warnings']:
    for warning in stability['stability_warnings']:
        print(f"‚ö† {warning}")
```

# For large models (>1MB SBML files):
# - Uses GenomeScaleAnalyzer
# - Creates sparse matrices automatically
# - Provides performance warnings
network, dynamics, solver, viz = from_sbml("large_model.xml")

# For small models:
# - Uses standard parsing
# - Dense matrices for efficiency
# - No performance overhead
```
